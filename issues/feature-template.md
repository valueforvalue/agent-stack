# Feature Template

Enhancements use a parallel template that mirrors the bug
template's rigor. The full procedure — 3-tier commit rule,
module discipline, pipeline phasing, slice plan template —
lives in `../core/feature-protocol.md`. This file is the
issue-filing companion.

The GitHub-side YAML form lives in
`../templates/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.yml`.

## Required sections

Every section is required unless marked optional:

```markdown
## Summary
<One sentence: what the feature does and who it serves.>

## User story
<As a <role>, I want <capability>, so that <outcome>.>

## Locked decisions
<Numbered list of decisions settled during recon. Each cites
the source: "Decided in <PR/issue/chat on YYYY-MM-DD>". Locked
decisions are NOT re-opened during the Critique phase unless
the user explicitly says so.>

## Proposed UX
<Per apply-site, what the user sees. References the screen by
name and surface by ID.>

## Apply sites (v1 checklist)
- [ ] <Surface 1>
- [ ] <Surface 2>

The feature is not "shipped" until every box is checked.

## Glossary changes (if any)
<Quote the new entry exactly as it should appear in
CONTEXT.md. If the feature uses existing terms only, write
"None.">

## Schema sketch (if any)
<Migration SQL + version bump + seed data.>

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] <Observable, testable in 5 min>

## Quality bar

The Acceptance criteria answer *does it work?* The Quality bar
answers *is it good enough to ship?* The two are separate —
a feature can pass acceptance and still fail quality.

Tick every box below that applies. Add new boxes (don't
remove the defaults) for anything this slice ships that
should hold itself to a higher bar than the framework floor.

- [ ] **Test floor met.** Every new exported identifier
      carries a doc comment + at least one passing test (per
      `../core/laws.md` §'Doc comments on exported
      identifiers').
- [ ] **Smoke probe per apply-site.** Every UI apply-site
      has a Playwright (or analog) probe that drives the live
      binary + asserts response shape + `page.url()` after
      the click (per `../core/tdd.md` §'Per-layer recipes').
- [ ] **Adjacent-behavior sweep green.** No regression in
      the slice's screen-family or shared JS dispatcher (per
      `../core/tdd.md` §'Adjacent behavior sweep').
- [ ] **A11y baseline.** Tab order intact; icon-only
      buttons have `aria-label`; form inputs have labels;
      modal focus traps + Escape close (per
      `../core/bug-patterns.md` §'Accessibility').
- [ ] **Performance budget acknowledged.** If the slice
      adds a query in a hot path, a per-iter footprint
      doc-comment lives next to it (per `../core/tdd.md`
      §'Algorithm speed').
- [ ] **Docs updated.** Glossary entry added if a new term
      ships; CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` bullet lands in the
      same commit; any new public surface ID is in the
      per-stack registry (per `../core/glossary-discipline.md`
      + `../core/commit-and-branch.md`).

The `ready-for-agent` label applies only when **every
applicable** Quality-bar box is ticked *and* the Acceptance
criteria are testable. **Unchecked quality bars are an
explicit pre-merge blocker**, not an optional follow-up.

## Slice plan
### Slice 1: <name>
- Files: <paths>
- Success criteria: <observable>
- Regression net: <test / probe / manual step>

## Test plan
- Unit: <file: TestXxx>
- Handler: <file: TestXxx>
- Migration: <file: TestXxx>
- Smoke probe: audit/smoke_<feature>.mjs (per UI apply-site)

## Files
- <bulleted list of every file that will be touched>

## Regression net
- <unit test names + audit/smoke probe filenames>

## Related
- <issue numbers, ADR numbers, docs/COMMON_BUGS.md refs>
```

## What shifts vs the bug template

| Bug section | Feature section | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Symptom | User story | Bug has a wrong-behavior; feature has a missing-capability |
| Repro | (skip — UI walk is in the apply-sites list) | Features don't repro; they get exercised by the user story |
| Root cause | Locked decisions | Bug has a why-broken; feature has a why-this-shape |
| Proposed fix | Proposed UX | Bug fixes are scoped to code; features span code + UI |
| Files | Apply sites + Files | Bug touches specific files; feature touches a surface area |
| Regression net | Test plan | Bug needs one net; feature needs per-apply-site nets |
| (none — bug passes acceptance once it stops being wrong) | Quality bar | Bug fixes don't have a quality bar (the bug is the bar); features have a level-above-acceptance checklist (test floor, smoke probes, a11y, perf, docs) |

## Labels

| Label | When to apply |
|---|---|
| `enhancement` | Always. Every feature gets this. |
| `needs-triage` | Locked decisions unknown or apply-sites list empty. |
| `needs-info` | User story clear but the locked decisions or apply-sites need the reporter to clarify. |
| `ready-for-agent` | Full template filled in, locked decisions cited, apply-sites checklist complete, slice plan testable. |
| `ready-for-human` | Feature is straightforward but needs human judgment. |
| `wontfix` | Decision to not implement. Must include reasoning. |

Apply `ready-for-agent` only when the P (Plan) phase is
complete. If the issue has User story + Apply sites but no
Locked decisions or Slice plan, leave it at `needs-triage`.

## Anti-patterns

- **Filing a feature without apply-sites.** The checklist
  is the contract; an empty list signals "I haven't thought
  about where this lives in the UI."
- **One mega-slice.** A slice plan with a single "Slice 1:
  ship the whole thing" line is no plan. Decompose until
  each slice is Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3.
- **Filing the design in the issue body.** The issue is the
  research + acceptance + slice plan. Architecture decisions
  live in `docs/designs/<slug>.md`.
- **Locking decisions the user hasn't settled.** Locked
  decisions cite their source. If a decision is "I think we
  should X", it isn't locked — list it under "Open
  questions" instead.
- **Skipping the smoke probe.** Every UI apply-site needs a
  smoke probe that checks both response shape AND
  `page.url()` after the click.
